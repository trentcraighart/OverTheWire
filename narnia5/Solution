Solution and Method

Upon examining the binary, we need to find a way to change the value of i. Since the input is being checked, we have to look for a new way to exploit.

Using printf() to show user input, we can begin to throw in our own %n values to modify a variable.
the following string will take the address, and insert 500 (%n writes the length of a string) into the address provided. 

./narnia5 $(python -c 'print "\xf0\xd4\xff\xff" * 125 + "%n"')
