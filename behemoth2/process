With behemoths code being a bit more robust, I've spent awhile looking at the gdb debug for things of note.
One of the first things that stood out to me was the cmp at 0x080485bf where if the conditional isn't met,
the program unlinks. The value it's comparing against is 0x8000 in hex which equates to 32768 in decimal.

My gut reaction is the process ID probably needs to be equal to that value in order for the program to not unlink
itself in the first comparision. While playing around with idea, I realized that it was probably just the upper
limit of the system for the pid. 

The next thing I thought about was finding a way to hook the system calls in order to execute my own code. To
do this I did some reserch and found that changing enviromental variables could be a way to get touch to execute 
the shell.

With this you can go into a tmp folder and change the path variable to be equal to the location where your 
fake touch shell script is.
